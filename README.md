## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
